DndDough is a browser based dice roller app. You can currently roll any valid DnD die [d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20]. 

You can remove/add dice, select a theme and enable/disable sounds (saving of these preferences works through local storage). All dice can be rolled at once and dice can be individually rerolled. Dice spawn with a 0 value and will not be automaticly rolled. 

Simple Dice "templates" can be made by appending dice type and count to the url, some examples:
    - `?8_2` will load 2 d8's 
    - `?8_3_10_2` will load 3 d8's and 2 d10's


At any moment you can copy current dice, this will give you a dice template you can "save" and append the base url with.
